# BasicFlaskSetup
#### This is a very basic flask setup so I can copy and paste this when I need an advanced Flask website
#### This uses: flask, flask_sqlalchemy, flask_wtf, flask_bcrypt, flask_login
#### It is connected to a database, login system, hashed passwords, form system.
##### Yuh
```
pip3 install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_wtf flask_bcrypt flask_login
